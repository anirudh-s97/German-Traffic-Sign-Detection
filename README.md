Self Driving Cars is an interesting complex problem which uses Deep Learning extensively. Here I aim to solve a sub-problem of detecting traffic signs using Object Detection.
Developed a Yolov3 Model using Tensorflow and Keras that detects traffic signs and classify them into 4 classes.

To detect various traffic signs and classify them into any of the 4 defined classes in the problem: The traffic signs include,
